# Quarto Template for Rendering Word Documents for the Journal of Forensic Sciences

This is a template for creating Microsoft Word documents in the style required by the Journal of Forensic Sciences.
The author guidelines for the journal can be found here [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15564029/homepage/forauthors.html](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15564029/homepage/forauthors.html).

This template should be helpful for preparing submissions when there are a lot of equations that need to be included (rather than having to type them out in the Word document directly).

The CSL file was modified from Zotero's Vancouver citation style available [http://www.zotero.org/styles/vancouver](here).
